## 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue 1: "No PE strikes found"**
```python
# Solution: Your data has all positive deltas
# The system automatically handles this by using position-based PE selection
# Check enhanced_vega_analysis_tab.py for PE logic
```

**Issue 2: "Range predictions too wide/narrow"**
```python
# Solution: Adjust sensitivity parameters
range_predictor.vega_sensitivity = 0.5  # Increase for wider ranges
range_predictor.gamma_sensitivity = 0.4  # Increase for breakout consideration
```

**Issue 3: "Predictions not learning"**
```python
# Solution: Enable feedback and check minimum predictions
analyzer.feedback_enabled = True
analyzer.min_predictions_for_learning = 5  # Reduce minimum
```

**Issue 4: "Database errors"**
```python
# Solution: Delete predictions.db and restart
import os
if os.path.exists("predictions.db"):
    os.remove("predictions.db")
```
